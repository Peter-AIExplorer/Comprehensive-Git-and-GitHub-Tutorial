# Branching and Merging in Git

When working on a project, you may need to create a branch to make modifications and later merge it back into the main branch. Branching in Git allows for independent work streams, making it especially useful in a team setting, as each member can work on different parts of the code without causing conflicts.

Branches can be thought of like stems on a tree. The main branch acts as the trunk, while new branches are stems that hold commits (like leaves). These branches can nest, with one branch leading to another, creating a structured project history.

## Why Use Separate Branches?

Separate branches help keep project components isolated, allowing team members to work independently and integrate their changes without interfering with each other’s work.

## Creating and Managing Branches

### 1. Creating a New Branch
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

### 2. Switching to a Branch
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>   # Switch to an existing branch
git checkout main            # Switch back to the main branch
```

### 3. Creating and Switching to a New Branch Simultaneously
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

> **Note:** New branches are based on the branch you’re currently on. Ensure you’re on the correct base branch before creating a new branch.

Alternatively, you can create a branch based on a different source branch with:
```bash
git branch <new-branch-name> <source-branch>
```

## Pushing and Pulling Changes

1. **Staging and Committing Changes:**  
   After making changes, you’ll need to stage and commit them.
   

2. **Pushing Changes to GitHub:**
   After committing locally, push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

3. **Updating Local Repository with Remote Changes:**  
   Keeping your local repo up-to-date with remote changes is essential when working in a team. You can pull updates with:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

4. **Syncing Local and Remote Branches:**  
   When you create a new branch, sync it with the remote repository during the first push:
   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name-to-push>
   ```
   Alternatively:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

   After the initial setup, you can simply use `git push` for subsequent commits.

## Best Practices with Pulling and Merging

It’s generally better to pull updates on the `main` branch, as this ensures all branches are updated with the latest changes.

## Pull Requests (PR)

A pull request allows you to share changes with your team. Once approved, these changes can be merged into the main branch.

When pushing updates to a branch other than `main`, create a pull request to merge the changes. For main branch updates, pull requests can sometimes be bypassed, although using a PR for all updates is best practice, especially in collaborative environments.

### Creating a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub

1. **Open the Pull Request:**
   - Select "New Pull Request."
   - Choose the branch you want to merge into and the branch you’re merging from.
   
2. **Review Changes:**
   - Review your changes to ensure everything is correct.
   
3. **Submit the PR:**
   - Select "Pull Request."
   - Optionally, update the title and description with details about the PR.
   - Select "Create" to finalize.

The team lead or designated reviewer can then review the PR and provide feedback. If there are no conflicts, they can merge the PR.

### Merging the Pull Request

To finalize the merge on GitHub:

1. **Select "Merge Pull Request"**
2. **Confirm the Merge**

You’ll see a confirmation that the PR was successfully merged and closed. The main branch now contains the updates, but Git and GitHub still retain the branches. If you’re finished, you can delete the branch on GitHub.

> **Note:** Once all commits have been integrated and no branch is behind, deleting the new branch is recommended to keep the repository clean.


# Synchronizing Merged Changes from Remote to Local Repository

After merging branches on GitHub (remote repository), the merge will not reflect in your local repository until you pull the updates. This ensures your local `main` branch matches the latest state of the remote repository.

## Pulling Updates into the Local `main` Branch

To update your local `main` branch with the latest changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Alternatively: Pulling Changes Based on Current Branch Context

Since the pull request is based on the branch you’re currently in, it’s often best to first switch to the `main` branch before pulling updates. Here’s how:

1. **Switch to the `main` Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the Latest Updates:**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

> **Note:** Make sure there are no uncommitted changes before pulling updates on any branch. Uncommitted changes can lead to merge conflicts or prevent the pull operation from completing successfully.
