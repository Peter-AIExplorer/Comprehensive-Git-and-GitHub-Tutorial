## Introduction

Git is a powerful version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects effectively. This tutorial will walk you through the fundamental and advanced features of Git and GitHub, including branching, merging, resolving merge conflicts, and advanced Git commands.

## Branching and Merging

In the **Branching and Merging** section, you will learn:

- How to create and switch between branches.
- The importance of separating branches for different parts of a project.
- How to merge branches and the significance of pull requests.

### Key Commands

- `git branch <branch-name>`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switch to a specified branch.
- `git merge <branch-name>`: Merge changes from one branch into another.
- `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>`: Sync local and remote repositories.

## Merge Conflicts

The **Merge Conflicts** section covers:

- What merge conflicts are and how they occur.
- Steps to resolve merge conflicts using your editor or IDE.
- Best practices for managing changes during a merge.

### Key Commands

- `git checkout main`: Switch to the main branch.
- `git pull`: Update your local branch with changes from the remote repository.
- `git add .`: Stage resolved files for commit.
- `git commit -m "resolve merge conflict"`: Commit the resolved changes.

## Advanced Git

In the **Advanced Git** section, you will explore:

- Techniques for checking out specific commits and resetting changes.
- How to use `git revert` to maintain a log while undoing changes.
- The purpose of `git stash` for saving changes temporarily.

### Key Commands

- `git checkout <commit-hash>`: Check out a specific commit.
- `git reset --soft <commit-hash>`: Reset to a commit while keeping changes staged.
- `git revert <commit-hash>`: Undo changes while preserving the commit history.
